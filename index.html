        <h3><em>Software Engineer</em></h3>
        <p>As a self-taught software engineer
            with 1 year of experience in Python,
            HTML, and CSS, I have developed a passion
            for problem-solving and possess strong leadership
            qualities. In addition to my technical skills,
            I am an avid fitness enthusiast, frequently visiting the gym
            and hiking in the mountains. I also love traveling and playing
            sports with friends, which allows me to explore different cultures
            and connect with people from all walks of life.</p>
